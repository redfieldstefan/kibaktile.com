Gudrun’s accomplishments as a hand builder coupled with Susanne’s exposure to the original Malibu Tile, and Catalina Tile, tiles that were an integral part of the classic architecture so common in Southern California fostered a love and appreciation of design, integrity, and a clean aesthetic that inspired Susanne to pursue and acquire a degree in Ceramics from UC Santa Cruz."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"home-bio-p"},"After graduating, Susanne relocated to Central Oregon with the grand plan to travel to Italy and study with an artist working on large ceramic sculptures for public spaces.

Before long, making tile was more than a ticket to Italy, it was 1981 and Kibak Tile was a bonafide business.
