    Classic line for Ann Sacks, Camelot easily transforms a
    kitchen or bath from routine to showstopper. This pattern
    adds color and interest to the walls/floors of any
    Contemporary, Traditional, Craftsman, or Farmhouse style
    interior. Choose from our Warm, Cool, Neutral, or white color
    ways, OR infuse a bit of your own color story to create a truly
    personal look.`,
