  description: `Infuse your space with beautiful pattern and color using decorative ceramic tile.
    There are many different ways to feature decorative tile in any project. Use decorative tile
    over a large area to achieve an all-over pattern effect. Or drop-in single decorative tiles
    into solid colored field tile to give a pop of color to your installation. Border tiles in 3x6
    or 4x8 size are also available to pair with the larger decorative tiles. Each tile is
    hand-painted with ceramic glaze and kiln fired to create a beautiful and durable final product.
    Suitable for interior wall, countertop and low-traffic floors. Exterior use in non-freezing
    climates only. Tile dimensions are 6" x 6" and 8" x 8".`,
