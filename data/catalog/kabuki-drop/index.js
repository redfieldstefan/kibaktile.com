    suggestion of color to any interior without overwhelming
    impact. This pattern reads like a smaller mosaic pattern and
    is a great companion piece to some of the bolder larger
    patterns currently trending. Modern, Asian, Contemporary,
    Industrial, Nordic, this pattern really does it all.`,
