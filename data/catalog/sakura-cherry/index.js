  description: `The Kibak Cherry Tree mural is the classic corner stone of our
    Sakura Collection. Inspired by the aesthetic of Japanese art, the
    image of the Cherry Tree is tied to the themes of mindfulness and
    living in the present, their blooming time so fleeting.
    Each unique mural is delicately handcrafted specifically for your
    space piece by piece, and embodies deliberate artisan skillfulness,
    and beauty. Whether you choose one delicate branch as an accent,
    or, to cover an entire surface, the allure of these tiles will influence
    the mood of your interior space.`,
